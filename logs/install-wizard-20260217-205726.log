== Hardware Detection ==
Detected hardware profile and proposed defaults.
Detected chassis: desktop
Battery detected: no
Fingerprint device hint: no
Proposed profile: desktop
Use these defaults as starting point? [Y/n]: 
== Core Layer ==
Base OS stack: kernel, network/audio/session baseline, microcode/GPU, bootloader config, and Btrfs snapshots.
Install core layer? [Y/n]: 
Kernel profiles:
  1) zen-lts      (recommended: zen main + lts fallback)
  2) mainline-zen (rc/mainline main + zen fallback)
  3) zen-stable   (zen main + stable fallback)
  4) none         (skip kernel package changes)
Choose profile [1-4] (default 1): Install CPU microcode? [Y/n]: Install GPU drivers? [Y/n]: Configure systemd-boot quiet default + fallback? [Y/n]: Configure Btrfs snapshots (Snapper) when root is Btrfs? [Y/n]: 
== Repo Layer ==
Repository/AUR setup: Chaotic-AUR and paru.
Install repo layer? [Y/n]: Configure Chaotic-AUR? [Y/n]: Install paru? [Y/n]: 
== Service Layer ==
System services: reflector, ufw, bluetooth, fstrim, sshd, tailscale, power profiles.
Install service layer? [Y/n]: Enable reflector periodic mirror refresh? [Y/n]: Enable firmware updates (fwupd)? [Y/n]: Enable zram swap profile? [Y/n]: Apply SSH hardening (root login off, key-only when keys are present)? [Y/n]: Enable laptop extras (fingerprint + laptop power helpers)? [y/N]: 
== Userland Layer ==
Desktop and user tools: curated apps, development toolchain, gaming stack, and optional COSMIC packages.
Install userland layer? [Y/n]: Apps bundle includes browser/mail/editor/productivity + utilities:
  firefox, thunderbird, helix, flatpak, topgrade, disk utility, media viewers,
  nerd fonts, and best-effort candidates for OnlyOffice/Zed (+ some AUR extras if paru exists).
Install apps bundle? [Y/n]: Development bundle includes:
  Python toolchain (python/pip/virtualenv/pipx/uv) + Rust toolchain (rustup stable)
  plus build/debug tools (base-devel, cmake, clang, lldb, pkgconf).
Install development bundle? [Y/n]: Gaming bundle includes:
  steam, lutris, gamemode, mangohud/goverlay, wine-staging/winetricks,
  gamescope, and 32-bit Vulkan/Mesa runtime dependencies.
Install gaming bundle? [Y/n]: COSMIC bundle uses available repo/AUR package names (best effort):
  cosmic-session, cosmic-desktop, cosmic-comp, cosmic-launcher, cosmic-settings,
  cosmic-files, cosmic-terminal, cosmic-store, etc.
Install COSMIC packages where available? [Y/n]: 
== Summary ==
Review selected layers before execution.
Core:      yes (kernel=mainline-zen, microcode=yes, gpu=yes, boot=yes, snapshots=yes)
Repos:     yes (chaotic=yes, paru=yes)
Services:  yes (laptop extras=no, reflector timer=yes, fwupd=yes, zram=yes, ssh hardening=yes)
Userland:  yes (apps=yes, dev=yes, gaming=yes, cosmic=yes)
  - apps: browser/mail/editor/productivity utilities (+ best-effort OnlyOffice/Zed/AUR extras)
  - dev: Python + Rust toolchains with base build/debug tooling
  - gaming: Steam/Lutris/Wine/Gamescope with Vulkan runtime deps
  - cosmic: install available COSMIC packages from repo/AUR candidates
Run postflight validation at the end? [Y/n]: Proceed with selected actions now? [Y/n]: [RUN] core

The unit files have no installation config (WantedBy=, RequiredBy=, UpheldBy=,
Also=, or Alias= settings in the [Install] section, and DefaultInstance= for
template units). This means they are not meant to be enabled or disabled using systemctl.
 
Possible reasons for having these kinds of units are:
• A unit may be statically enabled by being symlinked from another unit's
  .wants/, .requires/, or .upholds/ directory.
• A unit's purpose may be to act as a helper for some other unit which has
  a requirement dependency on it.
• A unit may be started when needed via activation (socket, path, timer,
  D-Bus, udev, scripted systemctl call, ...).
• In case of template units, the unit is meant to be enabled with some
  instance name specified.
Maintenance setup complete (fwupd + zram-generator).
